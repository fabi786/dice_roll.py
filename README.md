# 🎲 Dice Rolling Simulator

This is a simple Python script that simulates the rolling of two six-sided dice. Each time you run the script, it randomly generates and displays two numbers between 1 and 6—just like rolling a pair of dice.

## 🛠️ Features

- Generates two random dice values on each roll.
- Uses Python's built-in `random` module.
- Loop continues based on user input (`yes` or `y` to roll again).
- Simple and interactive terminal interface.

## 📋 How to Use

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Clone this repository or copy the script.
3. Run the script using:

   ```bash
   python dice_roll.py
